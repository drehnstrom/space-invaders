I've analyzed the codebase. It's an AngularJS 1.7 single-page application that runs a simple "Space Invaders" style game.

Key components:
- **Frontend**: `index.html` loads the app.
- **Logic**: `controllers/aliensController.js` manages the game state (hero, enemy, missile, bomb) and interactions.
- **View**: `views/aliens.html` renders the game board using `ng-style` for positioning.
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed via Docker (Nginx) or on a VM (Apache, via startup script).
- **Kubernetes**: Various deployment manifests are available.

I'm ready to help with the update. What would you like to change?
